+ Project summary: In this project, we created an CNN model with 3 layers for classification. In model 2, we define a label cleaning network.
	
**Contribution statement**: 
+ Jiaqi Lu: Model1, Model2
+ Yonghao Xu: Model1, Model2
+ Jia Wei

Jiaqi and Yonghao write model 1 together and tried several ways to "add model and procedures" in model 2, and decided the best way, ie, the label cleaning network. The other methods included adding layers to CNN, address the overfitting in CNN, adding another loss function, etc.
