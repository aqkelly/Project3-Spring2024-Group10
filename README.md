+ Project summary: In this project, we first created a convolutional neural network (CNN) model with three layers as our Model 1. This model provided a foundation to assess the impact of noisy labels on image classification accuracy and however requires advanced strategies to refine label quality and model robustness. Acknowledging the limitations faced by Model 1, we then created Model 2, which introduced a weakly supervised learning approach aimed at enhancing classification accuracy by using a subset of clean labels. As a result, Model 2 demonstrated improved performance over Model 1, validating the hypothesis that including weak supervision can reduce the effects of label noise.
