### A Note on Contributions

Whenever we have team projects, there are always concerns on unequal contributions from members of a project team. In the ideal world, we are all here to put in our best efforts and learn together. Even in that ideal world, we have different skill sets and preparations, and we will still contribute differently to a project. 

Therefore, you are required to post a *contribution statement* in the root README.md of your GitHub repo. Please beware that your GitHub repo will become public and remain public after the due date of the projects. 

Post your title, team members, project abstract and a contribution statement in the README.md file.  This is a common practice for research scientific journals. 

Below is an example. If no contribution statement is provided, we will insert a default statement that goes "**All team members contributed equally in all stages of this project. All team members approve our work presented in this GitHub repository including this contributions statement**. "

Project 3

Team members: Jiaqi Lu, Yonghao Xu, Lei Bao, Ada Wei

Summary: In this project, we developed a weakly supervised learning strategy and improved the classification accuracy for images 80%.

[Contribution Statement] Jiaqi and Yonghao designed the study. They first built up a base CNN model separately, then they spend more than 10 hours in model 2. They first used the principle of weakly supervised learning, but with a misunderstanding that they just used a linear model after the CNN model. This method clearly failed, then Yonghao spend time researching and trying to find the best way of improving model1, while Jiaqi reread the weakly supervised learning tutorial and the given paper (Inoue et al. (2017)). In this section, Yonghao tried 3+ different methods, including adding a new loss function, adding a new layer to the CNN model and handle with the overfitting issue. Jiaqi, on the other hand, spend all her time to write a correct label cleaning network schema and overcome many coding error, the most common one is dimension different. After all the effort, they developed the label cleaning network.

Lei is the persentor of this project. Her went to Jiaqi place on Monday and asked her questions about the project. She also tried to help Jiaqi with their model 2 and came out with some ideas, though all ideas were defeated by label cleaning network.

Ada combined the work done by Jiaqi and Yonghao (model 1 from Yonghao and model 2 from Jiaqi).
